This package defines `Seq` and `Alphabet` type, and provides some basic operations of sequence,
like validation of DNA/RNA/Protein sequence, getting reverse complement sequence and translation of RNA to protein.

This package was inspired by
[biogo](https://github.com/biogo/biogo/blob/master/alphabet/alphabet.go).
